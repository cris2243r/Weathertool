This is a simple vue app that uses the open weather API to finds cities and display their current weather.  I tried to 
use as few dependencies as possible for the sake of simplicity.  In "real-life" there would be some tools I'd reach for
that would keep things more concise.

There are already a number of things to refactor but I had to timebox this.  Hopefully there is enough here to warrant a discussion.

Thanks for reviewing!
